# .travis.yml
#
# This is the configuration file to drive Travis CI for Slang.

language: cpp

# Let's test against both major compilers just to be sure.
compiler:
  - clang
  - gcc

matrix:
  include:
    - os: linux

# Travis wants to default to a build script that invokes
# `./configure && make && make test` which is appropriate
# for autoconf, but I don't want to get into that mess..
#
script: make && make test
