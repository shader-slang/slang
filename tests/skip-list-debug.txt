# Skip list for debug builds
# These tests are skipped to reduce CI time in debug builds.
# Each line is a path prefix - tests starting with these paths will be skipped.

# Skip most neural tests in debug builds, except for a few basic ones:
#   - basic-inline-vector-test.slang (basic inline vector functionality)
#   - basic-coopmat-vector-test.slang (basic cooperative matrix vector)
#   - mma-helper-test-single-warp.slang (basic MMA single warp)
#   - neural-module-discovery-diagnose.slang (module discovery diagnostics)

# TODO: Those test expose the issue that our compiler is very slow in debug mode
        when specializing complicated generics. We might need to optimize this
        in the future. File an issue to track the this #9755.
