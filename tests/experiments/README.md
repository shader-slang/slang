Experiments
===========

The tests in this directory are all disabled. This set of tests is probably only temporary, and exists to document attempts to use certain language features.

There may be multiple versions of an attempt, when this is the case a number will be added to the suffix. In general tests like this can be considered to have been attempts in that order. 

Some of these tests *do* compile, but are kept because they provide the end of a train of thought. The solution may not be ideal, or the best way to implement in Slang. So they are kept here for completeness.

Some of the issues may be due to a bug, or unimplemented feature in the compiler.

Others may not work because it is not the appropriate way to achieve the desired effect. 

Surprising Observations
=======================

* let is needed for int generic parameter.
