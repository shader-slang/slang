Tests that were disabled for Reasons
====================================

This document is intended to track tests that have been disabled temporarily so that we can understand the cause and try to re-enable them when possible.

Test that don't work with shader objects in render-test
-------------------------------------------------------

The following tests were disabled because they had been running on non `-shaderobj` code paths that have since been removed.
These tests will need to be re-enabled together with changes to the shader object implementation, or removed entirely if they no longer test useful functionality.
