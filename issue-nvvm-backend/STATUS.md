# NVVM current status

The CUDA-text route migration is **complete with focused local acceptance**. NVVM no longer
infers operations from CUDA assembly-body strings or active semantic tags. The final field-offset
recognizer is replaced by a typed query that preserves the exact field key before optimization.
Explicit LLVM/libdevice names and genuine primitive PTX remain intentional backend interfaces.
Module43, ABI46 and container2 are unchanged. The signed16 O3 failure is corrected by provider-side
normalization at exact-width integer consumers. The consolidated integration checkpoint is accepted;
operation dispatch, shared type-role admission, structured-buffer planning, fake-provider maintenance
and architecture refresh are accepted. Native Half ceil/floor/trunc and single-rounded FMA are
accepted. The requested full validation checkpoint is accepted; standard feature work resumes below.

The accelerated workflow authorized on 2026-09-30 remains in effect: eight build jobs, larger
related batches, focused compile/PTX/runtime checks and no routine module-version bumps or full
campaigns. The maintainer superseded the earlier stop-after-log request. The maintainer has resolved the
offset scope: preserve existing NVVM restrictions and leave CUDA/CPP behavior unchanged. The final
offset migration is accepted. The maintainer has now authorized the ordered correctness,
integration, cleanup and Float16 work below; continue through bounded reviewed local commits,
stopping only for a decision that actually needs human input. After all queued cleanup and Float16
work, the maintainer additionally requests a full NVVM validation checkpoint, fixes for discovered
issues, and resumption of feature development under the standard workflow. No push, Slack or system changes.
Preserve the user's untracked `tests/cuda/complex/tiled_brass_material_mtlx_update.slang` unchanged.

[HISTORY](HISTORY.md) explains Git recovery. Raw full evidence is under ignored
`build/nvvm-integration/full-after-cleanup-1/`; Half evidence remains under
`build/nvvm-half-native/` and earlier cleanup evidence retains its recorded paths.
Plans and reports remain uncommitted.

## Current full acceptance

The requested post-cleanup/Half checkpoint is accepted after independent review.
All exact corpus and surface outcomes match the earlier full baseline:

| Validation             | Result                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Main corpus            | 1,704 correct / 36 known unresolved across 1,740 cells; 21 resolved histories preserved                        |
| Physical surfaces      | 214 pass / 24 known compile failures / 11 known NVRTC mismatches across 249 cells                              |
| Native units           | 1,173 pass / 12 inherited skips; four stale assertions repaired and retried                                    |
| Semantics / capability | 1,171 pass / 78 inherited skips; 106 capability tests pass                                                     |
| Toolkit / material     | 18 toolkit, 6 material compile/assembly and 12 material runtime cells pass                                     |
| Runtime / numerical    | Main runtime 4; supplemental 18 fresh plus mapped/reused coverage; numerical 99 fresh + 3 qualified Half cells |
| Static / contracts     | 5 direct static units; 119 runner contracts + 83 surface contracts pass, one inherited contract skip           |

No unexpected compiler/runtime regression remains. The full native run initially had four stale
call/diagnostic assertions; exactly four focused retries pass after test-only corrections. One
supplemental surface diagnostic similarly expected a deferred field error instead of the earlier
`imageLoad` rejection; only its expected diagnostic changed, and its retry passes. Initial failures,
exact inventory changes, test-only identity differences and unchanged no-mutation checks are retained.
The checkpoint does not claim every backend's full repository suite or publication/CI readiness.

Native Half ceil/floor/trunc emit directed Half conversions. FMA uses RN16(exact(a*b+c)), correcting
3e02 double rounding to 3e01 for the motivating inputs. LibNVVM12.9's trunc limitation requires
checked Half/i16 transport around `cvt.rzi.f16.f16`; whole-module verification remains enabled.
These instructions require SM53 or newer; this batch is qualified at SM80 and SM50/52 is unqualified.
Round ties and approximate exp2/tanh remain separate documented policies. CUDA is comparison
evidence, not an automatic oracle; retain the documented Vulkan/D3D12 contract distinctions.

## Full checkpoint identity

The full run used repository revision `d35654675` after test-only repairs. Production compiler
source is revision `593a686f79ea51e3248373f9aaf47e1593140e32` plus implementation patch
`a8d5e12e3d2b5b795d17dfbe0fcd1eb9b645fb1cc1a7cc324ef42971f0998ce8`;
see accepted identity for authoritative full revision/hash values. The configured compiler string
remains `2026.18.3-350-gdc0a9acc3`; later commits do not relabel binaries.
Compiler SHA-256: `1a9a6c04b7414f47fc74cdb0e0f13293085a2637f1e3e6ea8899af1bdd4547e9`.
Provider SHA-256: `9ace32f8b44d19e9e09256f7f58555a24b262a429f238ce9b51576870bab83c6`.

The [accepted baseline](accepted-baseline.json), [accepted identity](accepted-identity.json) and
[focused evidence](focused-evidence.json) retain exact current outcomes, all 42 earlier feature
objects, input/binary/configuration hashes and precise reuse. Earlier performance and other
historical claims retain their original identities. Raw current full evidence is under
`build/nvvm-integration/full-after-cleanup-1/`.

Environment: native Ubuntu 24.04, eight logical AMD EPYC CPUs, about 30 GiB RAM, L4 SM89,
UUID `GPU-7e9accb6-0e0f-7bb1-cafe-c1d02947b736`, driver 595.71.05, CUDA 12.9.2 / NVRTC 12.9.86,
LLVM 14, target SM80. CPU-only checks overlapped the main GPU checkpoint; no performance claim.

## Current feature and next action

The migration, ordered cleanup, native Half batch and requested full checkpoint are complete.
Resume bounded reviewed feature work under WORKFLOW, retaining eight-job incremental builds and
economical focused validation. No automatic full campaign follows each feature.

Five bounded feature batches now pass focused validation after the full checkpoint:

- UInt2 low/high word transport for selected read-only texture handles resolves the two NVVM
  `gh-6657-nonbindless-uniform` discovery cells. Three units, three runtime cells, four existing
  buffer negatives and record layout checks pass. Unsupported resource roles remain excluded.
- In-range dynamic surface-component stores resolve four NVVM physical cells. Eight physical
  runtime cells, two distinct units and four existing negatives pass. The merge converts only the
  replacement and preserves untouched physical lanes. A fake Float32/Boolean classification bug
  and an overbroad call-count assertion were fixed; original attempts remain recorded.
- Internal mutable and readonly references to existing local record arrays support nested forwarding
  and source returns through canonical OutParam lowering. The mutable batch passes three shared,
  two static and nine runtime cells; readonly passes four shared, two static and nine runtime cells.
  Readonly access preserves caller mutation visibility and cannot grant writes. Native array/pointer
  results, external roles and unproven pointer roots remain excluded.
- Non-array, non-mip texture dimensions now accept Float32 outputs through ordinary numeric casts.
  One typed-operation unit and three runtime modes pass. Four retained mip/MS negatives pass after
  correcting stale expectations to the existing earlier capability/type diagnostics; failures retained.

The full baseline retains its original 36 corpus gaps and four dynamic-surface failures; focused
records supersede the affected cells without relabeling the full run. Current identities and
precise reuse are in `features.nvvm-texture-descriptor-words`,
`features.nvvm-dynamic-surface-components`, `features.nvvm-local-record-array-references` and
`features.nvvm-local-record-array-borrows` and `features.nvvm-texture-float-dimensions`. Five
implementations have passed focused validation since the full run.

Next investigate actual array layer counts through documented device queries before proposing a
resource ABI change. Existing whole-resource probes suggest height/depth can supply some counts, but
restricted-view behavior remains unqualified. Start with one full versus restricted 2DArray view
comparison; keep mip counts, cube-face interpretation and singleton host bindings separate. The full
dimensions corpus failure remains unresolved. No new full campaign.

Approximate Half exp2/tanh remain a separate accuracy/capability choice; other transcendental
policies stay unchanged until supported by evidence. Dynamic surface indices remain in-range
qualification with non-atomic whole-texel RMW and no new out-of-range guarantee.

## Retained boundaries

Module43 requires older user modules and separately supplied built-ins to be recompiled for every
backend. Metadata inspection and source fallback remain available. The active NVVM semantic-tag
extension is removed; inert serialized slots and ordinary explicit intrinsic arguments remain.

Preserve all 36 main gaps and focused NVRTC narrow-bit/nested-array failures and timeouts.
Packed/normalized surfaces, general aliases, broader resource provenance and three-channel
transfers remain outside current physical legalization. Checked address/memory plans
remain authoritative; structured-buffer load/store conversions are planned, while other resource
family planning and broader aggregate admission remain feature work.
Barrier convergence, external Half ABI, numeric sweep, material-runtime and performance conclusions
retain prior qualifications. Snapshot caching remains non-atomic with external libdevice replacement.
Repeated bare-static-state dispatch in nvvm-copyable-kernel-context remains unresolved. Relinking a
compiled requirement-free component may retain cached target output after option changes.
CUDA `dim3 == uint3` source emission remains unsupported.
