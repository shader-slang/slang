(Add a new sub section 3.36.Reorder Instructions) ::
+
For reorder instructions providing a hint, the hint value used for reordering
is the specified number of bits from the LSBs of the hint value interpreted as
an unsigned integer. The higher bits of that hint value are higher priority than the
lower bits. If both the hint and the hit object are provided, the implementation
should prioritize the hint bits lower in the reorder priority than the shader
referenced by the hit object but higher than any other information in the hit
object.

The semantics of the arguments of *OpHitObjectTraceRayEXT* and *OpHitObjectTraceRayMotionEXT*
are same as those with the same names of <<OpTraceRayKHR,*OpTraceRayKHR*>> and

Validation Rules
----------------

An OpExtension must be added to the SPIR-V for validation layers to check
legal use of this extension:

----
OpExtension "SPV_EXT_shader_invocation_reorder"
----

Interactions with SPV_NV_ray_tracing_motion_blur
------------------------------------------------

If the 'SPV_NV_ray_tracing_motion_blur' extension is not supported, the
*OpHitObjectTraceRayMotionEXT*, *OpHitObjectRecordMissMotionEXT*,
and *OpHitObjectTraceMotionReorderExecuteEXT* instructions are not supported.

Interactions with SPV_KHR_ray_tracing_position_fetch
----------------------------------------------------

If the 'SPV_KHR_ray_tracing_position_fetch' extension is not supported
the *OpHitObjectGetIntersectionTriangleVertexPositionsEXT* instruction
is not supported.

Interactions with SPV_KHR_ray_query
-----------------------------------

If the 'SPV_KHR_ray_query' extension is not supported the
*OpHitObjectRecordFromQueryEXT* instruction is not supported.
