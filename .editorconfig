# This file sets up basic text editor behavior
# using EditorConfig: http://EditorConfig.org.
#
# Some editors will import and use the settings from
# this file automatically, while others need a plugin.

# Editors are supposed to search upwards from a source
# file to find configuration settings until they see
# a "root" file. This file should be a root:
#
root = true

# Shared configuration for all C/C++ and Slang code
#
[*.{c,cpp,h,slang}]

# Use UTF-8 encoding
#
charset = utf-8

# Indent using 4 spaces.
#
indent_style = space
indent_size = 4

# Insert a newline at the end of the file
# if one is missing (this used to be officially
# required by C, but it is also just a tidyness thing)
#
insert_final_newline = true

# Remove any extra whitespace characters at the
# end of a line. This is just for tidyness, to
# minimize the chances of introducing whitspace
# diffs that are hard to spot.
#
trim_trailing_whitespace = true
