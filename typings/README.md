# Python type stubs

This directory holds [Python stub files](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/#stub-files) to improve the editing experience for Python code in this repo, such as [LLDB data formatters](https://lldb.llvm.org/use/variable.html).

If you use Pyright (e.g. via [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance) in VS Code) then these will be picked up automatically; other tools may require additional configuration to see them.
