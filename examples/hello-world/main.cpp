// main.cpp

// This file implements an extremely simple example of loading and
// executing a Slang shader program. This is primarily an example
// of how to use Slang as a "drop-in" replacement for an existing
// HLSL compiler like the `D3DCompile` API. More advanced usage
// of advanced Slang language and API features is left to the
// next example.
//
// The comments in the file will attempt to explain concepts as
// they are introduced.
//
// Of course, in order to use the Slang API, we need to include
// its header. We have set up the build options for this project
// so that it is as simple as:
//
#include <slang.h>
//
// Other build setups are possible, and Slang doesn't assume that
// its include directory must be added to your global include
// path.

// For the purposes of keeping the demo code as simple as possible,
// while still retaining some level of portability, our examples
// make use of a small platform and graphics API abstraction layer,
// which is included in the Slang source distribution under the
// `tools/` directory.
//
// Applications can of course use Slang without ever touching this
// abstraction layer, so we will not focus on it when explaining
// examples, except in places where best practices for interacting
// with Slang may depend on an application/engine making certain
// design choices in their abstraction layer.

    //
    // * There are other overloads of `operator[]` that use the
    //   *index* of a parameter/field instead of its name, and those
    //   operations have fixed/constant overhead and perform no
    //   string comparisons. The indices used are independent of
    //   the target platform and graphics API, and can thus be
    //   hard-coded even in cross-platform code.
    //

    // PSO, binding our root shader object to it (which references
    // the `Uniforms` buffer that will filled in above).
