// main.cpp

// This file implements an extremely simple example of loading and
// executing a Slang shader program. This is primarily an example
// of how to use Slang as a "drop-in" replacement for an existing
// HLSL compiler like the `D3DCompile` API. More advanced usage
// of advanced Slang language and API features is left to the
// next example.
//
// The comments in the file will attempt to explain concepts as
// they are introduced.
//
// Of course, in order to use the Slang API, we need to include
// its header. We have set up the build options for this project
// so that it is as simple as:
//
#include <slang.h>
//
// Other build setups are possible, and Slang doesn't assume that
// its include directory must be added to your global include
// path.

// For the purposes of keeping the demo code as simple as possible,
// while still retaining some level of portability, our examples
// make use of a small platform and graphics API abstraction layer,
// which is included in the Slang source distribution under the
// `tools/` directory.
//
// Applications can of course use Slang without ever touching this
// abstraction layer, so we will not focus on it when explaining
// examples, except in places where best practices for interacting
// with Slang may depend on an application/engine making certain
// design choices in their abstraction layer.

    // In order to bind shader parameters to the pipeline, we need

    // The Slang compiler assigns locations to parameters in a deterministic
    // fashion, so it is possible for a programmer to hard-code locations
    // into their application code that will match up with their shaders.
    //
    // Hard-coding of locations can become intractable as an application needs
    // to support more different target platforms and graphics APIs, as well
    // as more shaders with different specialized variants.
    //
    // Rather than rely on hard-coded locations, our examples will make use of
    // reflection information provided by the Slang compiler (see `programLayout`
    // above), and our example graphics API layer will translate that reflection
    // information into a layout for a "root shader object."
    //
    // The root object will store values/bindings for all of the parameters in
    // the `IShaderProgram` used to create the pipeline state. At a conceptual
    // level we can think of `rootObject` as representing the "global scope" of
    // the shader program that was loaded; it has entries for each global shader
    // parameter that was declared.
    //
    // Readers who are familiar with D3D12 or Vulkan might think of this root
    // layout as being similar in spirit to a "root signature" or "pipeline layout."
    //
    // We start parameter binding by binding the pipeline state in command encoder.
    // This method will return a transient root shader object for us to write our
    // shader parameters into.

    // We will update the model-view-projection matrix that is passed
    // into the shader code via the `Uniforms` buffer on a per-frame
    // basis, even though the data that is loaded does not change
    // per-frame (we always use an identity matrix).
    //
    auto deviceInfo = gDevice->getDeviceInfo();

    // We know that `rootObject` is a root shader object created
    // from our program, and that it is set up to hold values for
    // all the parameter of that program. In order to actually
    // set values, we need to be able to look up the location
    // of speciic parameter that we want to set.
    //
    // Our example graphics API layer supports this operation
    // with the idea of a *shader cursor* which can be thought
    // of as pointing "into" a particular shader object at
    // some location/offset. This design choice abstracts over
    // the many ways that different platforms and APIs represent
    // the necessary offset information.
    //
    // We construct an initial shader cursor that points at the
    // entire shader program. You can think of this as akin to
    // a diretory path of `/` for the root directory in a file
    // system.
    //
    ShaderCursor rootCursor(rootObject);
    //
    // Next, we use a convenience overload of `operator[]` to
    // navigate from the root cursor down to the parameter we
    // want to set.
    //
    // The operation `rootCursor["Uniforms"]` looks up the
    // offset/location of the global shader parameter `Uniforms`
    // (which is a uniform/constant buffer), and the subsequent
    // `["modelViewProjection"]` step navigates from there down
    // to the member named `modelViewProjection` in that buffer.
    //
    // Once we have formed a cursor that "points" at the
    // model-view projection matrix, we can set its data directly.
    //

        deviceInfo.identityProjectionMatrix, sizeof(float) * 16);
    //
    // Some readers might be concerned about the performance o
    // the above operations because of the use of strings. For
    // those readers, here are two things to note:
    //
    // * While these `operator[]` steps do need to perform string
    //   comparisons, they do *not* make copies of the strings or
    //   perform any heap allocation.
    //
    // * There are other overloads of `operator[]` that use the
    //   *index* of a parameter/field instead of its name, and those
    //   operations have fixed/constant overhead and perform no
    //   string comparisons. The indices used are independent of
    //   the target platform and graphics API, and can thus be
    //   hard-coded even in cross-platform code.
    //

    // We also need to set up a few pieces of fixed-function pipeline
    // state that are not bound by the pipeline state above.
