Slang COM Example
=================

The goal of this example is to demonstrate Slang generating CPU code that can be communicated with via Common Object Model (COM) style interfaces. 

The `shader.slang` file contains Slang code that uses COM interfaces. 

The `main.cpp` file contains the C++ application code, showing how to use the Slang API to load and compile the shader code and communicate via interfaces.
