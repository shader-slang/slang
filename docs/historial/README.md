Historical Artifacts
====================

This direction collects documentation that has been checked into the codebase at various points during development, but that is no longer relevant or accurate to the state of the project and codebase today.
These documents are likely only of interest to those who want to piece together the history and evoution of the project.

Research
--------

The Slang project is the product of a long history of research work, but the academic publications on Slang are no longer the best place to go in order to understand and use the system.

A [paper](http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/projects/slang/) on the Slang system was prestented at SIGGRAPH 2018, and it provides an overview of the language and the compiler implementation.
Yong He's [dissertation](http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/projects/renderergenerator/yong_he_thesis.pdf) provided more detailed discussion of the design of the Slang system.
