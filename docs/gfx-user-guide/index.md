Slang Graphics Layer
=============

The Slang Graphics Layer is an abstraction library of graphics APIs to support cross-platform applications that utilize GPU graphics/compute capabilities. The Slang Graphics Layer tightly integrates the Slang shading language, allowing it to provide full platform-independent development experience and streamlined shader specialization and parameter binding.

In this documentation, we walk through various parts of the library and demonstrate how it can be used in your application.
