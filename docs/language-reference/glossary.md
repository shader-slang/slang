# Glossary

[Implementation-defined behavior](basics-behavior.md#classification)
: The observable behavior is defined by the implementation and it is documented. Implementation includes the
  target language, the device and its driver, and the declared extensions and the available capabilities.

[Observable behavior](basics-behavior.md#observable)
: Program behavior observable over the execution interface. The interface includes resource variables,
  shared memory, and execution control.

[Precisely defined behavior](basics-behavior.md#classification)
: The observable behavior is precisely defined for all targets.

[Undefined behavior](basics-behavior.md#classification)
: The observable behavior is not defined. Possible results include crashes, data corruption, and inconsistent
  execution results between different optimization levels or different targets.

[Unspecified behavior](basics-behavior.md#classification)
: The observable behavior is unspecified but within boundaries. Documentation is not required.
