Graphics Shaders and Compute Kernels
====================================

This section describes the graphics and compute entry points, and their inputs and outputs.

> **TODO**

Graphics pipeline stage entry points: (aka graphics shaders)
- fragment
- vertex
- geometry
- hull
- domain
- raygeneration
- intersection
- anyhit
- closesthit
- miss
- callable
- task
- mesh

Compute kernel entry points:
- compute
