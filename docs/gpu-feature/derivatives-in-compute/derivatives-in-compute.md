### Derivatives In Compute 
An entry point may be decorated with `[DerivativeGroupQuad]` or `[DerivativeGroupLinear]` to specifiy how to use derivatives in compute shaders. 

GLSL syntax may also be used, but is not reccomended (`derivative_group_quadsNV`/`derivative_group_linearNV`).

Targets:
* **_SPIRV:_** Enables `DerivativeGroupQuadsNV` or `DerivativeGroupLinearNV`.
* **_GLSL:_** Enables `derivative_group_quadsNV` or `derivative_group_LinearNV`.
* **_HLSL:_** Does nothing. sm_6_6 is required to use derivatives in compute shaders. HLSL uses an equivlent of `DerivativeGroupQuad`.
