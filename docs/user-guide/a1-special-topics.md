This chapter covers several additional topics on using Slang. These topics do not belong to any categories covered in previous chapters, but they address specific issues that developers may frequently encounter.

In this chapter:
1. [Handling matrix layout differences on different platforms](a1-01-matrix-layout.md)
2. [Using Slang to write PyTorch kernels](../deprecated/a1-02-slangpy.md)
3. [Obfuscation](a1-03-obfuscation.md)
4. [Interoperation with target-specific code](a1-04-interop.md)
5. [Uniformity Analysis](a1-05-uniformity.md)
