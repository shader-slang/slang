Slang User's Guide
=============

Welcome to the Slang User's Guide, an introduction to the Slang language, compiler, and API. In this guide, you will learn:
- Slang's language features, including those inherited from HLSL and additional language features to make it easy to work with shaders.
- The compiler API that controls how to assemble shaders from different pieces of code, and how they are compiled for different targets.
- The reflection API that allows the host application to query the details of shader code in order to generate the right shader kernel and to set shader parameters correctly.

Note: this documentation is still under active development. While the coverage on language features is complete, we are still working on the remaining chapters on Slang's compilation and reflection API.
