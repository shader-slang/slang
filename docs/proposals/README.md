Proposals
=========

This directory contains proposals / "RFCs" for Slang language/compiler/system features.
In general, proposals are used for features that are large or complicated enough that the design and/or plan benefits from being discussed in detail before we commit to making code changes.

Design *discussion* can often be facilitated by a GitHub/GitLab issue, or PR review comments, but often it is difficult for a developer to get a clear summary of the final decisions/POR without reading an entire discussion thread.
By framing design discussion around a document that captures the decisions, we hope to ensure that the at the end of the discussion we have useful collateral for anybody who goes to implement a feature.
