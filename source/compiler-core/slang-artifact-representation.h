A representation as a file. If it is a temporary file, it will likely disappear.
A file representation does not have to be a representation of a file on the file system.
That is indicated by getFileSystem returning nullptr. Then the path is the path on the *actual* OS file system.
This distinction is important as it is sometimes necessary to have an artifact stored on the OS file system
to be usable. */
