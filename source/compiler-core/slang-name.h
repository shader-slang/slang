// The `Name` type is used to represent the name of a type, variable, etc.
//
// The key benefit of using `Name`s instead of raw strings is that `Name`s
// can be compared for equality just by testing pointer equality. Names
// also don't require any memory management; you can just retain an ordinary
// pointer to one and not deal with reference-counting overhead.
//
// In order to provide these benefits, a `Name` can only be created using
// a `NamePool` that owns the allocations for all the names (so they get
// cleaned up when the pool is deleted), and which is responsible for
// ensuring the uniqueness of name objects.
//
class Name : public RefObject
{
public:
    // The raw text of the name.
    //
    // Note that at some point in the future we might have other categories
    // of name than "simple" names, and so this might change to a structured
    // ADT instead of a simple string.

/// Get the text as unowned string slice 
UnownedStringSlice getUnownedStringSliceText(Name* name);

// Get a name as a C style string, or nullptr if name is nullptr
const char* getCstr(Name* name);

// A `RootNamePool` is used to store and look up names.
// If two systems need to work together with names, and be sure that they
// get equivalent names for a string like `"Foo"`, then they need to use
// the same root name pool (directly or indirectly).

    Dictionary<String, RefPtr<Name> > names;
};

// A `NamePool` is effectively a way of storing a subset of the
// names that have been created through a `RootNamePool`.
//
// The intention is that eventually we will add the ability to clean
// up a `NamePool`, and remove the names it created from the corresponding
// `RootNamePool` *if* those names are no longer in use.
//
// The goal of such an approach would be to ensure that the memory
// usage of a `Session` can't bloat over time just because of multiple
// `CompileRequest`s being created, used, and then destroyed (each time
// adding just a few more strings to the name mapping).
