    /// An environment for mapping existing values to their cloned replacements.
    ///
    /// This type serves two main roles in the process of IR cloning:
    ///
    /// * Before cloning begins, a client will usually
    ///   register the mapping from things that are to be
    ///   replaced entirely (like function parameters to
    ///   be specialized away) to their replacements (e.g.,
    ///   a constant value).
    ///
    /// * During the process of cloning, env environment
    ///   will be maintained and updated so that when, e.g.,
    ///   an instruction later in a function refers to
    ///   something from earlier, we can look up the
    ///   replacement.
    ///
struct IRCloneEnv
{
        /// A mapping from old values to their replacements.
    Dictionary<IRInst*, IRInst*> mapOldValToNew;

        /// A parent environment to fall back to if `mapOldValToNew` doesn't contain a key.
    IRCloneEnv* parent = nullptr;

        /// Should `mapOldValToNew` keep a copy of children's oldToNew mapping?
    bool squashChildrenMapping = false;
};

    /// Look up the replacement for `oldVal`, if any, registered in `env`.
    ///
    /// Returns `nullptr` if `oldVal` has no registered replacement.

IRInst* lookUp(IRCloneEnv* env, IRInst* oldVal);

// The SSA property and the way we have structured
// our "phi nodes" (block parameters) means that
// just going through the children of a function,
// and then the children of a block will generally
// do the Right Thing and always visit an instruction
// before its uses.
//
// The big exception to this is that branch instructions
// can refer to blocks later in the same function.
//
// We work around this sort of problem in a fairly
// general fashion, by splitting the cloning of
// an instruction into two steps.
//
// The first step is just to clone the instruction
// and its direct operands, but not any decorations
// or children.

    /// Clone `oldInst` and its direct operands.
    ///
    /// The "direct operands" include the type of the instruction.
    /// The type and operands of `oldInst` will be mapped to now
    /// values using `findOrCloneOperand` with the given `env`.
    ///
    /// Any new instruction that gets emitted will be output to
    /// the provided `builder`, which must be non-null.
    ///
    /// This operation does *not* clone any children or decorations on `oldInst`.
    /// This operation does *not* register its result as a replacement
    /// for `oldInst` in the given `env`.
    ///
IRInst* cloneInstAndOperands(
    IRCloneEnv*     env,
    IRBuilder*      builder,
    IRInst*         oldInst);

// The second phase of cloning an instruction is to clone
// its decorations and children. This step only needs to
// be performed on those instructions that *have* decorations
// and/or children.

    /// Clone any decorations and/or children of `oldInst` onto `newInst`
    ///
    /// Any new instructions that get emitted will use the
    /// provided `sharedBuilder`, which must be non-null.
    ///
    /// During the process of cloning decorations/children, operand values
    /// will be looked up in the provided `env`, which should provide
    /// replacement values for instructions that should have a different
    /// identity in the clone.
    /// The provided `env` will *not* be updated/modified during the
    /// process of cloding decorations/children.
    ///
    /// If any child or decoration on `oldInst` already has a replacement
    /// registered in `env`, it will *not* be cloned into `newInst`.

// on cloning operands before uses can be satisfied, we provide

    /// Clone `oldInst` and return the cloned value.

    /// This function is a convenience wrapper around
    /// `cloneInstAndOperands` and `cloneInstDecorationsAndChildren`.
