        // This method is the main engine for computing linearized inheritance
        // lists for types and `extension` declarations.
        //
        // The approach we use for linearization of an inheritance graph is based on
        // what is the most broadly-accepted solution to the problem, presented in
        // "A Monotonic Superclass Linearization for Dylan" by Barret et al.
        // The algorithm recommended in that paper is also called the "C3 linearization
        // algorithm." Many developers are most familiar with C3 linearization because
        // it is used to compute the method resolution order (MRO) for a class in Python.
        //
        // The basic idea is that given a type declaration like:
        //
        //      class A : B, C { ... }
        //
        // we can construct a linearization of the transitive bases of `A`
        // by merging the linearizations for `B` and `C`. Any transitive
        // base of `A` should appear in the linearization for `B` and/or `C`,
        // so the main tasks are to remove duplicates (when a base type appears
        // in both the linearization of `B` *and* `C`), and to ensure that
        // the ordering is reasonable.
        //
        // What makes an ordering "reasonable" is a little subtle, especially
        // in the context of Slang. In the original use case, the order of types
        // in the linearization would determine which methods would override
        // which other ones, so different orderings could have large semantic
        // impact. Slang currently has less support for overriding, but is
        // likely to add more over time.
        //
        // At the very least, we require that if `S <: T` for types `S` and `T`,
        // then `S` should appear *before* `T` in the linearization. This, e.g.,
        // guarantees that a concrete type that implements an `interface` will
        // be listed before that interface and thus during lookup the members
        // of the concrete type will be found before those of the `interface`.
        //
        // We will revisit the question of "reasonable" orderings later, as
        // we get more into the core of the algorithm.

        // Our linearization approach will construct a list of *facets* for
        // the `declRef` in question, where each facet corresponds to a
