Discussion 
==========

Currently we are only tracking 'var'/IRVar local variables. They are accessed via pointers. This
means

* We don't need to care about extractField / extractElement, as they only work directly on the value
* We need to track aliases created via getFieldPtr / getElementPtr
* There is a distinction between a 'pointer' and an 'address'.
  * A "pointer" can 'escape' just as in other languages, and is the general case
  * If we are talking about an "address", then this is constrained by our language rules,
  
NOTE! Confusingly there is getElementPtr and getFieldAddress (and getAddress). I also don't see Addr/Addr type as a distinct thing 
from Ptr, so I assume that differentiation is aspirational?

A) We don't need to worry about a phi node temporary holding a pointer (or scope ending *on* the branch), because
the phi node will pass the result by value, leading to a *load* before the branch..

Other

```
 let foo : Ptr<SomeStruct> = var;
...
store(someOtherPtr, foo); // this is `store`, but not a store *to* foo!!!!!
...
```

Here a *pointer* is being stored into someOtherPtr. This means all bets are off. Liveness will have to be assumed anywhere the 
variable is accessible. 
TODO(JS): Note that currently this scenario isn't handled by this algorithm.

```
   let foo : Ptr<SomeStruct> = var;
   ...
   br SomeOtherThing(foo); // OH NO!!!
```

It is believed this can't happen in current code. Leading to assertion A) above.

* Long-term IR type-system thing: we should probably have an explicit instruction
  that casts a local `Ptr<Foo>` to either an `Out<Foo>` or `InOut<Foo>` for exactly
  these cases (and then use the *cast* operation to tell us what is going on).

/*
Take the code sequence

```HLSL
    SomeStruct s;
    SomeStruct t = makeSomeStruct();
    SomeStruct u = {};
```

Produces something like...

```HLSL
    SomeStruct_0 s_1;
    SLANG_LIVE_START(s_1)
    SomeStruct_0 t_0;
    SLANG_LIVE_START(t_0)
    SomeStruct_0 _S4 = makeSomeStruct_0();
    t_0 = _S4;
    SomeStruct_0 u_0;
    SLANG_LIVE_START(u_0)
    SomeStruct_0 _S6 = { ... };
    u_0 = _S6;
```

This is good, in so far as the variables do get LIVE_START, however they are defined. It is perhaps 'bad' in so far as a temporary
is created that is then just copied into the variable. That temporary being something that is mutable, and can be partially modified (it's a struct)
could perhaps have liveness issues.

/* This implementation could potentially be improved in a few ways:

## Use Dominator tree block indexing

The dominator tree has a mapping from block insts to integer values. These integer value could be used to allow information about blocks to 
be stored in an array. A downside, would be exposing that aspect of the implementation to the dominator tree.

## Store if a block has an access instruction

As it stands, when traversing the tree to find the last access, the implementation searches for each block backwards to find the last access
by looking if it's in the m_accessSet. 

This searching could be avoided, by when accesses are added the block they are in is marked as having an access. If a block had no accesses
this would remove the linear search for the first access instruction, if the block indicates it doesn't have any. The downside being that every 
access would also have to mark the block it is in.
