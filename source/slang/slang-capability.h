// This file defines a system for reasoning about the "capabilities" that a
// target supports or, conversely, the capabilities that a function or other
// symbol requires.
//
// The central idea is that we can think of the each of these cases as a set,
// where the elements of the set are atomic features that are either present
// on a target or not (no in-between states). For example, an atomic feature
// might be used to represent support for double-precision floating-point
// operations. When compiling for a target, we need to know whether the
// target supports double-precision or not, and for a particular function
// it either requires double-precision math to run, or not.
//
// In this system, the atomic capabilities are represented as cases of
// the `CapabilityAtom` enumeration, which is generated from declarations
// in the `slang-capability-defs.h` file.
//
#include "slang-generated-capability-defs.h"

// Once we have a universe of suitable capability atoms, we can define
// the capabilities of a target as simply the set of all atomic capabilities
// that it supports.
//
// The situation is slightly more complicated for a function. A function
// might require a specific set of atomic feature, and that is the simple
// case. In this simple case, we know that a target can run a function
// if the features of the target are a super-set of those required by
// the function.
//
// In the more general case, we might have a function that can be used
// with multiple different combinations of features: e.g., you can use
// the function if your target supports features A and B, or if it supports
// features C and D. In our representation, that case is handled by
// assocaiting multiple distinct sets of capabilities with one declaration,
// with each set expressing one way that the declaration can be legally used.
//
// In all cases, we represent a set of capabilities with `CapabilitySet`.
