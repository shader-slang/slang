// This file implements a pass on the IR to make the "active mask" concept
// from HLSL explicit in the code, so that we can generate code for
// targets like CUDA where explicit masks are used for warp-/wave-level
// collective operations.
//
// At the time this pass was written, the exact semantics of the implicit
// active mask in HLSL (and GLSL/SPIR-V) had not been specified, so this
// file had to define what the semantics ought to be.
//
// The main guideline for these semantics is that it should conform to
// the user's view of control flow based on the high-level language.
//
// The intuitive version of the semantics provided by this pass are:
//
// * Code is conceptually executed by "shards" of threads/lanes, where
//   each shard consists of a subset of the threads/lanes in the warp/wave
//   that are executing "together."
//
// * When a shard encounters a structured control-flow statement, the
//   shard may fragment into sub-shards that partition its set of threads/lanes.
//   E.g. for a two-way `if` we end up with a sub-shard for threads/lanes
//   where the condition was `true`, and another sub-shard for the
//   threads/lanes where the condition was `false`.
//
// * When the threads in a shard exit some structured control-flow
//   statement normally (e.g., execution reaches the end of the "then"
//   statement for an `if`), those threads *re-converge* with all the other
//   threads that entered the structured statement together and which
//   exited normally.
//
// * When threads in a shard exit some structured control-flow statement
//   "abnormally" (bypassing the statements that logically come after),
//   those threads do *not* re-converge with the other threads that exited
//   normally, although they may still re-converge at the normal exit of
//   some lexically outer statement.
//
// Turning these rules into something formal mostly comes down to codifying:
//
// 1. when threads exit a structured control flow statement, and
// 2. which of those exits are "normal" vs. "abnormal."
//
// The Slang IR maintains structure information in its IR (similar to the
// information maintained by SPIR-V for Vulkan). For a structured control
// flow statement like an `if`, the IR-level representation encodes both
// the conditional branch for the `if`, but also the label/block representing
// the code that logically comes after the `if` in the high-level-language
// code. We can refer to a block like that as a "merge point."
//
// Our more formal divergence and re-convergence behavior then depends
// on two definitions:
//
// 1. Code is "inside" a control-flow structure if it is dominated by
// the entry block, but not dominated by the merge block. Control flow
// thus exits the structure whenever it branchs from a block inside the
// structure to some place not inside the structure.
//
// 2. An edge that exits a control-flow structure represents a "normal"
// exit if it branches to the merge block for the structure, and an
// "abnormal" exit otherwise.
//
// These definitions result in divergence and re-convergence behavior
// that closely matches what programmers expect from their high-level
// language code.
//
// (Note: because the definition of what code is inside a control-flow
// structure depends on dominance in the CFG, the existence of arbitrary
// `goto` operations that can jump "into" a control-flow statement would
// break our assumptions. This pass would only be compatible with
// `goto` operations that jump "out" of control-flow statements.)

// The translation of code to make masks explicit can be broadly
// broken up into:
//
// * Analysis and transformation of the entire module and its call
//   graph, to identify and update functions that need an explicit
//   active mask.
//
// * Analysis and transformation of a single function, that was
//   identified by the above logic.
//
// We will start with the whole-module logic.
//
// As it typical for our IR passes, we will wrap up the module-level
// synthesis work in a "context" type.
//

        //   is its immediate dominator, and would be part of a parent region
        //   that has already been processed up the call stack. That parent
        //   region would have established the active mask value to use on input
        //   to each of its successors.
