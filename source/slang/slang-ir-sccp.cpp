// This file implements the Spare Conditional Constant Propagation (SCCP) optimization.
//
// We will apply the optimization over individual functions, so we will start with
// a context struct for the state that we will share across functions:
//
struct SharedSCCPContext
{

// Next we have a context struct that will be applied for each function (or other
// code-bearing value) that we optimize:
//
struct SCCPContext

    IRGlobalValueWithCode*  code;   // the function/code we are optimizing

    // The SCCP algorithm applies abstract interpretation to the code of the

    // might take on.
