Liveness
========

## Status

Currently liveness tracking only tracks local variables in functions. 

In particular it doesn't handle:

* PHI temporaries 
* Variables that aren't constructed via IRVar
* Variables that might be introduced via slang-ir-restructure-scoping.h/.cpp
* Possible variable 'escape' via pointers (shouldn't be possible right now - but restructuring might introduce issues)
* Any tracking around undefined values

If enabled output source will output with SLANG_LIVE_START and SLANG_LIVE_END macros. It's a user space problem as to how to use these definitions (for example by adding a prelude).

## Motivation

At a first approximation liveness means variable is `in scope`. The underlying issue might be described as

```HLSL
struct SomeStruct
{
	int value;
	int large[100];
};

int someFunction()
{
	int result = 0;

	for (int i = 0; i < ...; ++i)
	{
		doSomething();

		SomeStruct s;
		s.value = ...;

		doSomethingElse(s);

		result += s.value;
	}

	return result;
}
```

A compiler might hoist `s` outside of the loop, looking something more like...

```
int someFunction()
{
	SomeStruct s;
	int result = 0;

	for (int i = 0; i < ...; ++i)
	{
		doSomething();

		s.value = ...;

		result += doSomethingElse(s);
	}

	return result;
}
```

The problem is that now `s` is in scope over the loop, and there is potential for values from one interation
to be used in the next iteration. This isn't a problem in the original version because it is 'obvious' that
a new `s` is constructed each iteration. The key observation being that when doSomething is executing, `s` doesn't exist,
and so doesn't need to take any register space.

Why hoist? Some compilers define variables via `alloca`s, and these allocas can only be placed at the start of the function. That being the case
their scoping for where the contents is 'live' is lost.

So liveness here is adding additional information about variables use. The start of the range is where there is a 'fresh' copy of the variable, and the 
end is where where the values held in the variable can no longer alter execution results. 

## Discussion

The previous discussion of liveness could be described as being at the 'variable' level.

Liveness could be tracked in a more fine grain manner - such as tracking field liveness. `s` has no `__init` and isn't 
initialized in any way. s.value does set some state, but `large` is untouched. So in a sense s.value holds *all* of the 
state of s at that point, and only s.value would need to be stored to reconstruct s (the rest could be undefined). 

Is this more nuanced information useful to a downstream compilation? Maybe, but the downstream compiler could perform all the same 
analysis. All it's really missing is knowing when there is a `fresh version` of s.

How does this apply to undefined values?

```
int someFunction()
{
	int result = 0;
	int v;				/// v's value is undefined

	for (int i = 0; i < ...; ++i)
	{
		doSomething();

		SomeStruct s;
		s.value = v;

		result += doSomethingElse(s);
	}

	return result;
}
```

In this somewhat silly example, s.value is set to an undefined value. At one level you could say that s is *all* in an undefined state, 
and therefore s is stateless. That's not quite right though because although v is undefined, it should probably be the same value 
every loop. 

Like before though, this may not matter too much in practice because a downstream compiler can see this behavior, and handle appropriately.

Another way a compiler could `see` that it has a `fresh copy` within the loop, would be for all it's state to be set.

```
int someFunction()
{
	SomeStruct s;
	
	int result = 0;
	
	for (int i = 0; i < ...; ++i)
	{
		doSomething();

		// (Note the syntax here is not Slang/HLSL, it's just meant to mean 'initialize s')
		s = SomeStruct{};

		s.value = v;

		result += doSomethingElse(s);
	}

	return result;
}
```

Here because of the initialization of *all* of `s`, a downstream compiler can infer that during `doSomething` it doesn't have to potentially store the contents
of `s` because it will be wiped out after the function. 

All of this gets more complex around branches. But again that is something a downstream compiler can track if it has a way of knowing when a variable is in scope. 
Similarly calling into a function could return a struct that contains fields which aren't set - this is something a downstream compiler could determine when 
fully specialized.
