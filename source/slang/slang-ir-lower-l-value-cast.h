#define SLANG_IR_LOWER_L_VALUE_CAST_H

// This defines an IR pass that lowers LValue implicit casts. These are typically formed 
// when an in/inout paramter is passed a type that doesn't match. 
// 
// Depending on the target this could produce
// 
// * Nothing - some kinds of casts are implicit for some targets such as HLSL on out parameters for same sized integer types
// * A reinterpret cast. On targets with pointers, such as C++/CUDA we can fix the problem by just casting to the appropriate pointer (for some kinds of conversions)
// * Creating a temporary of the right type and calling the function, and *converting* to the target (say an out parameter)
// * Creating a temporary, converting the value into the temporary, calling the function, and converting back to the source
