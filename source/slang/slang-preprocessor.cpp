// This file implements a C/C++-style preprocessor. While it does not aim for 100%
// compatibility with the preprocessor for those languages, it does strive to provide
// the same semantics in most cases users will care about around macros, toking pasting, etc.
//
// The main conceptual difference from a fully C-compatible preprocessor is that
// we do *not* implement distinct tokenization/lexing rules for the preprocessor and
// later compiler stages. Instead, our preprocessor uses the same lexer as the rest
// of the compiler, and operates as logical transformation from one stream of tokens
// to another.

// Input Streams
//

// A fundamental action in the preprocessor is to transform a stream of
// input tokens to produce a stream of output tokens. The term "macro expansion"
// is used to describe two inter-related transformations of this kind:
//
// * Given an invocation of a macro `M`, we can "play back" the tokens in the
//   definition of `M` to produce a stream of tokens, potentially substituting
//   in argument values for parameters, pasting tokens, etc.
//
// * Given an input stream, we can scan its tokens looking for macro invocations,
//   and upon finding them expand those invocations using the first approach
//   outlined here.
//
// In practice, the second kind of expansion needs to abstract over where it
// is reading tokens from: an input file, an existing macro invocation, etc.
// In order to support reading from streams of tokens without knowing their
// exact implementation, we will define an abstract base class for input
// streams.

    // The two fundamental operations that every input stream must support
    // are reading one token from the stream, and "peeking" one token into
    // the stream to see what will be read next.
