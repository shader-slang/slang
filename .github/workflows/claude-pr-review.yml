            Review this PR for the Slang shader compiler. Focus on:
            1. IR consistency: ensure IR passes maintain type invariants and don't break SSA form
            2. Target correctness: check that code generation changes work across SPIRV, HLSL, GLSL, Metal, CUDA targets
            3. Bugs and security issues: look for null dereferences, use-after-free, missing error handling
            4. Test coverage: verify new code has tests (CPU or INTERPRET mode for non-GPU features)
            5. API compatibility: flag changes to public headers (include/slang.h, slang-gfx.h) as potentially breaking

            ### Review workflow
            1. Fetch the PR diff and changed files list
            2. Read and analyze each changed file in the repository
            3. Create a PENDING review with mcp__github__create_pending_pull_request_review
            4. Add inline comments to the pending review using mcp__github__add_comment_to_pending_review
               for every bug, issue, suggestion, question, or non-trivial observation you find.
               Aim for at least one inline comment per changed file when there is something worth noting.
               Do NOT use inline comments for praise — save that for the summary.
            5. Submit the review with mcp__github__create_and_submit_pull_request_review including
               a top-level summary with overall assessment, positive feedback, and approval/request-changes decision.
            6. ALWAYS post a PR comment using mcp__github__add_issue_comment summarizing:
               - What the PR does
               - Key findings (bugs, risks, suggestions)
               - Verdict (approve / request changes)
               This ensures the author gets a visible notification even if the review submission fails.

            Inline comments are the most valuable part of the review. Be thorough — reviewers prefer
            specific, line-level feedback over vague top-level summaries.

            ### **Slang Compiler Context**
            - Slang is an SSA-based shader compiler with custom IR (not LLVM)
            - Pipeline: Lexer -> Parser -> Semantic Check -> IR Gen -> IR Passes -> Code Emission
            - Key source dirs: source/slang/ (compiler), source/core/ (utilities), source/compiler-core/ (infra)
            - IR instructions defined in slang-ir-insts.lua, generated code in build/source/slang/fiddle/

            ### **Review Priorities**
            - IR pass changes: verify input/output IR invariants are maintained
            - Emit changes: ensure all target backends are updated consistently
            - Keep emit logic simple; heavy transforms belong in IR passes
            - Check for proper use of FIDDLE macros in AST nodes
