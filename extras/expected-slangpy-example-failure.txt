# Slangpy examples that are expected to fail or should be skipped on CI
#
# Format: example_name (platform1, platform2, ...)
# Where platform can be: windows, macos, linux
#
# Lines starting with # are comments
# Empty lines are ignored
#
# Examples that require windowing/display (CI environments are headless)
# These fail with surface.configure() errors on headless runners
window
fwd-rasterizer
bitmap
render_pipeline
raytracing

# Examples that require PyTorch (not installed in CI due to size/time constraints)
# PyTorch is ~1-2GB and takes 2-5 minutes to install, which would slow down every CI run
# These are integration examples rather than core slangpy functionality tests
pytorch                  # Requires torch (PyTorch)
soft-rasterizer-pytorch  # Requires torch (PyTorch)

# Examples that are computationally expensive or may timeout
pathtracer

# Jupyter examples require Jupyter kernel
jupyter
