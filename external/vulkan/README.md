## Version Tagging Scheme

Updates to the `Vulkan-Headers` repository which correspond to a new Vulkan specification release are tagged using the following format: `v<`_`version`_`>` (e.g., `v1.1.96`).

**Note**: Marked version releases have undergone thorough testing but do not imply the same quality level as SDK tags. SDK tags follow the `sdk-<`_`version`_`>.<`_`patch`_`>` format (e.g., `sdk-1.1.92.0`).

This scheme was adopted following the 1.1.96 Vulkan specification release.
