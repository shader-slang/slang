/*! \brief The D3D12CircularResourceHeap is a heap that is suited for size constrained real-time resources allocation that 
is transitory in nature. It is designed to allocate resources which are used and discarded, often used where in 
previous versions of DirectX the 'DISCARD' flag was used. 

The idea is to have a heap which chunks of resource can be allocated, and used for GPU execution, 
and that the heap is able through the addSync/updateCompleted idiom is able to track when the usage of the resources is 
completed allowing them to be reused. The heap is arranged as circularly, with new allocations made from the front, and the back 
being updated as the GPU updating the back when it is informed anything using prior parts of the heap have completed. In this 
arrangement all the heap between the back and the front can be thought of as in use or potentially in use by the GPU. All the heap 
from the front back around to the back, is free and can be allocated from. It is the responsibility of the user of the Heap to make 
sure the invariant holds, but in most normal usage it does so simply. 

Another feature of the heap is that it does not require upfront knowledge of how big a heap is needed. The backing resources will be expanded 
dynamically with requests as needed. The only requirement is that know single request can be larger than m_blockSize specified in the Desc 
used to initialize the heap. This is because all the backing resources are allocated to a single size. This limitation means the D3D12CircularResourceHeap
may not be the best use for example for uploading a texture - because it's design is really around transitory uploads or write backs, and so more suited 
to constant buffers, vertex buffer, index buffers and the like. 

To upload a texture at program startup it is most likely better to use a D3D12ResourceScopeManager.

\code{.cpp}

typedef D3D12CircularResourceHeap Heap;

Heap::Cursor cursor = heap.allocateVertexBuffer(sizeof(Vertex) * numVerts);
Memory:copy(cursor.m_position, verts, sizeof(Vertex) * numVerts);

// Do a command using the GPU handle 
m_commandList->...
// Do another command using the GPU handle

m_commandList->...

// Execute the command list on the command queue
{
	ID3D12CommandList* lists[] = { m_commandList };
	m_commandQueue->ExecuteCommandLists(SLANG_COUNT_OF(lists), lists);
}

// Add a sync point
const uint64_t signalValue = m_fence.nextSignal(m_commandQueue);
heap.addSync(signalValue)

// The cursors cannot be used anymore

// At some later point call updateCompleted. This will see where the GPU is at, and make resources available that the GPU no longer accesses.
heap.updateCompleted();

\endcode

### Implementation

Front and back can be in the same block, but ONLY if back is behind front, because we have to always be able to insert
new blocks in front of front. So it must be possible to do an block insertion between the two of them.

|--B---F-----|     |----------|

When B and F are on top of one another it means there is nothing in the list. NOTE this also means that a move of front can never place it
top of the back.
