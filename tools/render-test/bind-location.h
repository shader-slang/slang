Bind Set/Point/Value
====================

The following classes are designed as a mechanism to simplify binding within the test system. The underlying issues are

* How binding occurs is very dependent on the underlying target (CPU is different from Dx for example)
  + CPU everything is just backed by uniform 'memory'/GPU uses different registers for different types
  + With unbound arrays CPU can just indirect to a buffer, on GPU it might need use of register spaces or some other mechanism (as in VK)
  + CPU groups together global/entry point parameters, GPU typically does not
* Having a mechanism that will the data/binding for the test independent of the actual target, allows that code/implementation to be shared across many targets.
* How a resource/state is configured within binding also varies significantly between targets

One way to handle this disparity, would be to build an abstraction layer, that could create the device specific
resources/state and set them. This is not the approach taken here though. The idea here is to have a mechanism to
be able to build structures in memory, and record where binding takes place without having to create any
device specific resources or state. This data can then be used to construct and then bind as is appropriate.

The process broadly for test system is is

1) Set up any default buffers required for a target (for example the uniform/entry point buffers for CPU)
2) Add any default Value/buffers that are needed by traversing reflection
3) Create/Set the Values for the elements of ShaderInputLayoutEntry
4) Go through the values set on the BindSet, creating Resources/State etc appropriate for the target
5) Go through the bindings setting the Resource bindings as appropriate for the target
6) Execute
7) If the computation takes place outside of Values backing memory, copy back the data for output entries
8) Write the output entries

To do this we need a mechanism to store a binding location. In the general case a BindingLocation might
track the location of many different categories of data.

We also need a way to record what we want to create on the device for execution. To do this we have the
BindSet::Value. 'Value' was used instead of 'Resource' because the types of things the Value might represent
may not be resource like or might be multiple resources. In simple use cases though a 'Value' is typically
synonymous with some kind of Resource on the device.

A Value knows the underlying type it represents as was determined via the slang layout/reflection. That an added
feature of 'Values' is there are able hold a buffer that is typically mapped onto some linear buffer on the
device. Doing so means that we do not need to store BindLocation mappings for say uniform data (like float or
matrix), it can just be stored in the memory buffer. When the resources are constructed for execution, we can
just copy over that data.

This all sounds well and good but there is a final underlying important aspect. That is that some resource
like bindings may have to be stored in a buffer. For example on a CPU we could have a constant buffer that contained
another constant buffer as a field. On CPU this field would be converted into a pointer which needs to be set up. On CUDA this might be some
device specific value. So before we can copy the memory representation to a device specific buffer we must convert
any such bindings into something appropriate in the memory buffer associated with the Value. To do this we can traverse
a record of all of the bindings (which are held on the BindSet), and then set the appropriate date for the device from
data stored in the associated 'Value'.

A final observation is that on CPU targets, the memory buffer held in the Value can just be used directly. 

NOTE: 

That these classes are written so they can be used to track locations across multiple categories such that binding
can work across many different types of targets. For the moment the mechanism/s are only tested on CPU like binding,
and there are quirks in how locations are traversed that have knowledge of how such bindings work. It may be necessary
for this to work more generally to only allow certain kinds of transitions based on some well defined specific
binding styles.

/* A bind point records a specific binding point (typically for a category). It records a space and an offset.
As with Slangs layout reflection, the offset meaning is dependent on category. It might be an offset to
a 'register'. If category is 'uniform' it might be a memory offset. The space defines the 'space' a register
is in.
Note that m_space is ignored (but must be valid) for uniform offsets.
